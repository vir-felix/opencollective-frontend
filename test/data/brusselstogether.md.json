{ "markdown": "There are many people who are trying to bring Brussels to the 21st century. People who are trying to redefine mobility, education, environment, art, culture, etc.\n\nWe need to support them. They need visibility, but they also need human, material and financial resources.\n\nToday, they mostly rely on very old and inefficient systems to get funding through subsidies. It's a distraction and it's not sustainable. There's got to be a better way.\n\nThat's what we want to explore with #BrusselsTogether. Can we recreate a city from the bottom up, with transparency, inclusiveness, and experimentation spirit as its core? A city where everyone is invited to contribute? A city where everything is possible.\n\nWe are starting by creating this open collective to gather everyone who wants to contribute to make Brussels a great city to live and work.\n\nDiscover the great initiatives that exist in Brussels, create yours or join one and contribute.\n\nBe part of the change. \n\nWe all have something to contribute.\n\n# Our Values\n\n## Inclusive\n\nWe are inviting everyone who spends time in Brussels and who wants to contribute to this movement. It doesn’t matter if you are a Belgian citizen or not, with or without work permit, what the color of your skin is. It doesn’t matter if you are able or disabled, poor or rich, straight or gay, male or female. You have a talent. And you should be able to express it. We will all benefit from it, we will all learn something from it. Your contribution is not only welcome, it is needed. If you have a project, if you want to organize an activity in Brussels, the default answer should be yes, let’s do it. And we will help you do it.\n\n## Positive and surreal\n\nBrussels has always been the city of the surrealism. Let’s embrace what makes us unique. Like we did with the cats during the surreal #BrusselsLockdown ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AB6K7rWlG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AB6K7rWlG4)) . Let’s show the world a new way to deal with the challenges of our time.\n\n## Constructive\n\nWe don’t have time to complain. We don’t have time to tell people what they should be doing or not. We only have time to support constructive initiatives, lead by people who have positive energy to share and who want to do their part.\n\n## Experimental spirit\n\nIt’s OK to fail. We are here to learn, together. Over time we will get better at identifying and supporting the projects the right way. In the meantime, everybody is invited to experiment, own its successes and failures, share them and contribute to the community’s learning process.\n\n## Every little contribution matters\n\nLike the hummingbird trying to extinguish the fire in the forest, we believe that we should all do our part. Every contribution is valuable. Every initiative, large or small, is important.\n\n## Apolitical\n\nWe don’t care which political party you are supporting. As long as you share the values of the movement, you are welcome. We are not a political party. We are not here to debate. We are here to get things done.\n\nWe can make Brussels the best, most vibrant and inclusive city of the world. \n\nJoin the movement. Submit projects. Experiment. Contribute. And spread the word. \n\n# About\n\nWe are all different, we have all our own aspirations, but we have at least one thing in common : we all look for happiness. \n\nEveryday, we realize how fragile it can be. From racism to terrorism, from traffic jams to strikes, from health emergencies to unemployment, from gender inequalities to poor child care services, we are growing impatient on the capacity of our governments to improve our well-being.\n\nMost of the time, we are resigned about it. Or cynical. We keep fighting for our personal objectives, while leaving the collective ones to God’s sake. But we have more power than we think we have. We must use it and act where we can have an impact.\n\nThat’s why we are starting a collective #BrusselsTogether. A movement where everyone is invited to do something to make Brussels a city that works for everyone. \n\nA city that is inclusive, open and always positive. A city that is safe, where living and working feels good, where people can easily meet and easily go from point A to point B, where there are always plenty of activities for everyone. Where everyone can feel at home. This is our best chance to win against extremism, radicalism and immobilism. This is our best chance to make Brussels a great city where we want to work and live. \n\n# FAQ\n\n## What?\n\n#BrusselsTogether is a collective to support anyone who has a project to make Brussels a great city to live and work in. \n\n## How?\n\n### Open\n\nWe are inviting everyone who cares about Brussels and who wants to contribute to this movement. Join the collective, propose a project that you want to lead and spread the word. It belongs to us to shape Brussels the way we want it.\n\n### Crowdfunded \n\nThis collective should be funded by the crowd for the crowd to ensure our integrity. We are open to individuals as well as companies’ support. We don't want to rely on the funding of any public institution.\n\n### Transparent\n\nWe will operate in full transparency. All the money going out of this collective will be trackable by anyone. And all the results of our actions will be measured as well.\n\n### Together\n\nWe believe that technology is revolutionizing the way we live and work, and we will use the full potential of it to run the collective and amplify our actions. But we also believe that people work better together in the same space, so we will provide physical space for those who want to spend time on specific projects."}
